## 4.0.0 (2020-04-13)

* Removed Flow and switched entire codebase over to TypeScript. In the process a few minor soundness issues were fixed.

* **Breaking change** Removed dependency on Node filesystem APIs so the library no longer needs a separate node and browser entrypoint, simplifying maintenance and development. This has the following implications for the public API, justifying the version bump to 4.0.0:
  *  You can no longer provide image data as a path, and need to provide an `ArrayBuffer` or base64-encoded string instead.

  *  You can no longer provide a template as a filesystem path, and you'll need to read it into a Buffer first.

  * Removed `output: 'buffer'` argument. The output of `createReport` is now always a `Uint8Array`, unless the debug argument `_probe` is specified.
  

The README and examples have also been updated to reflect the above changes.


## 3.1.1 (2019-8-20)

* Avoid issue when a single paragraph contains `END-IF/FOR` for a previous loop and `IF/FOR` for a new one (#72).
* Fix hyperlink styles (#64).

## 3.1.0 (2019-8-20)

* Allow different left/right command delimiters, e.g. `cmdDelimiter: ['{', '}']` (#66, #70).
* Allow omission of the `INS` (or `=`) command (#70).

## 3.0.0 (2019-2-17)

* **Breaking change**: removed `replaceImages`, `replaceImagesBase64` options (deprecated since v2.4.0). Please use the `IMAGE` command instead.
* **Breaking change for users of the `vm2` sandbox**: replaced `vm2Sandbox` option (which caused headaches for users in the browser) with `runJs`, a custom hook for JS snippet execution. If you want to use vm2:

```js
import createReport from 'docx-templates';
import { VM, VMScript } from 'vm2';

createReport({
  template: /* ... */,
  data: /* ... */,
  runJs: ({ sandbox }) => {
    const script = new VMScript(
      `
      __result__ = eval(__code__);
      `
    ).compile();
    const vm2 = new VM({ sandbox });
    vm2.run(script);
    const { VMError, Buffer, ...modifiedSandbox } = vm2._context;
    const result = modifiedSandbox.__result__;
    return { modifiedSandbox, result };
  }
})
```
